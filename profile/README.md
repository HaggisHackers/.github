# 🏴‍☠️ HaggisHackers  

Welcome to **HaggisHackers**, a collective of secondary school makers, coders, and builders from across Scotland! We tinker, break things (on purpose), and build cool stuff—whether it’s software, hardware, or something in between.  

## 🔥 What We Do  
- 💻 **Code** – Open-source projects, web dev, and experimental programming  
- 🔧 **Hack Hardware** – Electronics, robotics, and DIY tech  
- 🎮 **Game Dev** – Making, modding, and tweaking games  
- 🛠️ **Build Random Things** – If we can dream it, we’ll try making it  

## 🚀 Get Involved  
1. **Jump in!** Fork a project, suggest ideas, or start something new.  
2. **Collaborate** – Work with others and make something awesome.  
3. **Break, Fix, Learn, Repeat.**
